## **Wednesday, March 7, 2018**

1. Gathered at meeting place, connected laptop to monitor, discussed YouTube API troubles (keys)
2. Created GitMusic Firebase Database, changed Rules, copied key into files
3. Switched tasks to app design - Checked out color schemes, chose one
4. Discussed layout ideas for landing page
5. Decided on navbar with GitMusic title, video as full background, search bar with form
6. Got video and code (HTML/CSS/JS) for video background
7. Formatted navbar and search bar to the best of our abilities using Bootstrap CSS

## **Thursday, March 8, 2018**

1. Successfully got the landing page layout to work!
2. Looked at API Documentation and how to use Spotify and YouTube APIs, considered Last.fm as an alternative.
3. Looked at layouts for the search results page (the page with the artist's music and information).

## **Saturday, March 10, 2018**

1. Worked on APIs: Twitter, SeatGeek, Spotify, Vimeo
2. Twitter required creating our own server. Spotify and Vimeo as well.
3. Spotify required an access token.
4. Vimeo’s documentation was difficult to understand. Ended up using someone else’s client ID.
5. Fixed search button so that it would go to the search results page instead of redirecting to home page.

## **Monday, March 12, 2018**

1. SeatGeek API works!
2. Created server for Spotify to prevent constantly-expiring tokens.
3. Found Mashape for API guidance and MDBootstrap for templates and layout ideas.
4. Vimeo requires use of server/CORS.
